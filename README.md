# Live_Object_Detection
As part of this Repo i have created my own Live Object Detection code using Caff model
An object detection system recognises and searches the objects of the real world out of a digital image or a video, where the object can belong to any class or
category, for example humans, cars, vehicles and so on. Authors have used OpenCV packages, Caffe model, Python and numpy in order to complete this task of detecting an
object in an image or a video. To detect a live object, localise an object, categorise an object, extract features, appearance information, and many more, in images and
videos using OpenCV and how caffee model is used to implement .
